**VCET FOSS** is a student-driven Free and Open Source Software community at **Vidyavardhini's College of Engineering & Technology**.

We exist to fix one core problem in college tech culture:

> **Good projects shouldn’t die after a semester.**

---

## 🌱 Why VCET FOSS?

Every semester, students build projects.
Some are average.
Some are **really good**.
A few can grow into real products.

But most of them get abandoned.

VCET FOSS is here to change that by:
- Sustaining projects beyond academics
- Encouraging open-source collaboration
- Helping students find teammates, contributors, and mentors
- Building real-world engineering habits

---

## 🧩 What We Do

- Maintain a **public directory of student-built projects**
- Enable contributions via **GitHub pull requests**
- Encourage collaboration across years and departments
- Help solo developers find teams for hackathons and competitions
- Promote clean code, documentation, and ownership

This is not a club for certificates.  
This is a space for **builders**.

---

## 📂 Project Directory

All community projects live in our central registry:

👉 **[`awesome-foss`](https://github.com/vcet-foss/awesome-foss)**

Each project:
- Has a clear roadmap
